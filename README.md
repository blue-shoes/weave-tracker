# weave-tracker
Raspberry Pi Pico project with Pimoroni Pico Display for tracking configuration of current weaving project

<h1>Overview</h1>

After my wife commenting that during her weaving projects, she had difficulty keeping track of where she was in her weaving sequence, I, of course, began thinking of a tech solution that was cost-effective. A Raspberry Pi Pico and Pico Display Pack was less than $30 with shipping at the time, and gave me a chance to work with microcontroller-style programming with minimal hardware setup.

The latest release of the micropython library for pimoroni can be found here: https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/releases.
